    PHOTOSYNTHESIS - THE PROCESS OF LIFE
    
    Introduction:
    Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight 
    to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis in plants generally 
    involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a by-product.
    
    The Equation:
    6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2
    
    Key Components:
    1. Chloroplasts - The organelle where photosynthesis occurs
    2. Chlorophyll - The green pigment that absorbs light
    3. Stomata - Pores in leaves that allow gas exchange
    4. Light-dependent reactions - Occur in thylakoid membranes
    5. Light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle) - Occur in stroma
    
    Process Steps:
    1. Light absorption by chlorophyll
    2. Water splitting (photolysis)
    3. Oxygen release
    4. ATP and NADPH production
    5. Carbon fixation in Calvin Cycle
    6. Glucose synthesis
    
    Importance:
    - Produces oxygen for respiration
    - Forms the base of food chains
    - Removes COâ‚‚ from atmosphere
    - Provides energy for life on Earth
