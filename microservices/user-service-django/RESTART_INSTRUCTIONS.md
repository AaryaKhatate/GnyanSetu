# 🚀 RESTART DJANGO SERVER - IMPORTANT!

## ⚠️ Changes Made - Restart Required

The password validators have been updated but Django needs to be restarted to load them.

## 📋 What Changed

1. **Updated serializer** to pass user context to validators
2. **Cleared Python cache** (__pycache__ and .pyc files)
3. **Validators are ready** to enforce all password rules

## 🔄 How to Restart

### Step 1: Stop the Current Server
In the terminal running Django, press:
```
Ctrl + C  (or Ctrl + Break)
```

### Step 2: Restart the Server
```powershell
cd d:\GnyanSetu\microservices\user-service-django
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8002
```

## 🧪 Test After Restart

Try these passwords to verify the validators are working:

### ❌ Should FAIL:
- `naradmuni` → Missing: uppercase, number, special char
- `virat180` → Missing: uppercase, special char  
- `password123` → Missing: uppercase, special char
- `Password123` → Missing: special char
- `12345678` → Missing: letters, special char

### ✅ Should PASS:
- `TestUser123!`
- `MyPass2024@`
- `Secure99#`
- `Hello2024$`

## 📝 Expected Error Messages

After restart, you should see helpful messages like:

**Password: `virat180`**
```
Error: "Password must include at least one uppercase letter. 
Password must include a special character (!@#$%^&* etc)."
```

**Password: `naradmuni`**
```
Error: "Password must include at least one number.
